## Abstract
This report documents our participation in a hackathon organized by Deutsche
Telekom, the University of Hamburg, NextReality.Hamburg eG, and Meta in
May 2024. The event challenged participants to create an immersive in-store
experience for Deutsche Telekom customers using XR technology, with the goal
of improving the waiting experience in retail stores. Our team developed a
Mixed Reality (MR) prototype that enabled customers to explore a selection
of Telekom’s offerings interactively while waiting in line. Using Unity 3D with
Meta’s XR MR Utility Kit (UPM), we implemented a mixed reality (MR) expe-
rience that featured product-related virtual worlds. Despite challenges related
to code structure and tight deadlines, we successfully created a functional pro-
totype and secured a win by jury vote. This report provides an overview of the
design process, technical implementation, and potential future improvements,
such as enhanced interactivity and accessibility.
